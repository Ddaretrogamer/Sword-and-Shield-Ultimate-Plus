### A Brief History of the SWSH Demake

There have been 6 versions of this hack released by 4 developers.

- Swsh GBA (Portuguese) - PCLG (2020)
- SwSh GBA (English) - AStartGaming (2022)
- SwSh Ultimate GBA (Portuguese) - Jeanstars (2023)
- SwSh Ultimate GBA (English) - Phantonomy (2024)

This hack was originally created and released by Pclg in 2020. Jeanstars remade it, adding CFRU, dubbing it SwSh Ultimate which was released in 2023. I translated this version to English. Pclg released an overhaul of SwSh Ultimate, and dubbed it, SwSh Ultimate Plus. I then translated that version to English as well.

**The current version of the game is SwSh Ultimate Plus v1.2.1**\
